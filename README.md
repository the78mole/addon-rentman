## About

This is the rental manager add-on for Home Assistant. It is
based on [Franck Nijhof's](https://github.com/frenck)
[example add-on](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-example)
for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)

It will help you to identify the relevant data to create
the bills for your tenants of your home or your building.

If you do not have all the data in your Home Assistant, because you
collected your data manually, it will give you an opprtunity to
provide manual data for historic data or corrected data for
malfunctioning sensors.
